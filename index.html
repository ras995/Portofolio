            <h1>30MFF</h1>
            <p>For my first project, it challenged me to go out of my comfort zone. It was my first time ever to create a personal website. Our 30MFF was based upon raising awareness in the midst of Covid by encouraging people to wear mask at all times for their safety and also to remind people that even though everything is virtual, the ones who seek creativity can get to it at all costs.

            <h1>COMIC</h1>
            <p>My second project was a storytelling comix strip based on animal animations.  As a team, our goal was to create a lighthearted experience where notions of love and warmth are explored. We project how, in life, people should never jump to conclusions and also show how far a person can go for the ones they love.

            <h1>SOUND</h1>
            <p>In my third project, we wanted the user to relive the experiences of World War 2 as a soldier. In our daily lives, most of the film industries donâ€™t show the real experience of a soldier, they tend to appeal to the audience by sugar-coating many issues.  Through graphic visuals, sound making and remixing in our project, the user gets to feel the trauma of soldiers back then.

            <h1>VIDEO</h1>
            <p>My last team project was to create a video that describes step by step the process of making an origami. The origami is making a comeback.  It is the ancient art of paper folding, and it has applications in the modern-day classroom for teaching geometry, thinking skills, fractions, problem solving, and fun science. Our video goal to be both informative and enjoyable at the same time.

        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>
      Hello, my name is Rakan Al Shaibani and I am majoring in IMB (Interactive Media+Business). My hobbie are poem writing and horse riding. I took Comm Lab as a major requiremnt, however, with time, I felt in love with it. My projects are insights of my artistic expressions and the skills I nourished throughout the class journey. As a poet, I can profoundly say that I now learned that i can express my feelings in various forms. The WEB Platform showed me how authenticity plays a role in the design part and how each one's definiton on how a web shall look is different.
