        The project is to portray the harsh and unforgiving nature of trench combat that took place during WW1. The project would portray the average soldier during the war. The concept is to portray the confusion, stress and horror the average soldier is faced with when fighting against an enemy they don't fully know and for a purpose that is unknown to them. The confusion and stress was to be shown through audio where at the start the monologue showed the soldiers not wanting to be there and were more than ready to go back home. The confusion and horror was to be shown by the overwhelming sounds of war and the constant danger of death they brought upon the battlefield. Another concept was to portray a sense of position on the battlefield. That was to be done through implementing an interactive image of a battlefield where the user can click on an initial image that would play a sound file. After the sound file finished playing a new one showed up in a new position on the map that gave a sense of progression and would show the entire story once it was done.

        The other concept was to maintain accuracy and authenticity to the era where sounds and voice lines would be as close as possible to the real thing. Gun Sounds and other sounds of war were to sound similar to rifles used during the war, footsteps and other ambiance should suggest the correct battlefield where the battles were fought at (Mud, Gravel) as well as other miscellaneous things (Radio, talking in different languages).

        The theme was to show the importance of individual life and how it was discarded when thousands died on a daily basis without contributing even the slightest to the theater of war. This was to be shown by the short length of the audio play as it signified the short life the average soldier had on the battlefield.

        Most documentaries show warfare on the big scale where individuals are only numbers. Most movies show a soldier heroically fighting waves of enemies. We wanted to show an average soldier that was drafted not by choice(as most were) and the unpreparedness he faced on the frontlines that ultimately led to his untimely demise.

    <h1>Process:</h1>

    <h3>
      The concept had 3 aspects, sound creation/recording, sourcing and editing sounds and lastly making the webpage that would house the sound files. We divided these tasks amongst ourselves such that two people focussed on sourcing and editing sounds, one on creation and recording sounds and one on the development of the webpage. Each of us shared our progress with the rest of our group daily to share constructive feedback.
    </h3>

    <h1>Creation of sounds</h1>

    <h3>
        While creating the sounds we had to be mindful to avoid any background or unwanted noise. Thus before recording we ensured that the air conditioner was switched off, door shut and that all recording was done under a blanket.

        With respect to the creation of sounds, there were two aspects to it. The first were the dialogues. The dialogues had to be recorded using the minimal equipment we had(our phones) and they had to be recorded multiple times to match the tone and emotion of the scene. Second aspect was using everyday objects to create sounds that would mimic a World War 1 battlefield. We went through various tutorials and got inspired by some behind the scenes footage of how sounds were created in various movies. So, we took it upon ourselves to get creative and make those sounds. The most important and recurring sound on the battlefield was that of gunfire and footsteps. To create gunfire sounds we put together sounds such as the clicking of a stapler, rifling through pages in a book and claps of varying intensities. Normal footstep sounds were easy to create but we needed to create sounds of soldiers walking in wet mud, so we used latex gloves and splashed our hand in a tub of water to create this sound.

    <h1> Sourcing and editing of sounds:</h1>

    <h3>
      While sourcing sounds we relied heavily on www.freesound.org. The challenge with the process was to find sounds that were appropriate with the scene and the era we were portraying. We didn’t want any factually incorrect sound to be used. For example, we didn’t use an amazing sound file of an RPG because the RPG was made much after World War 1. When editing sounds, we made sure to remove as much background noise as possible. The challenge here was to merge the created sounds with the downloaded sounds and to make them a part of the same piece. First, we merged the individual sounds we had created, such as that for the gun fire and looped it over and over again and layered it with heavier sounds that we had sourced, to make it sound authentic and to confuse the listener into believing that they were actual gunfire sounds. Through our editing process we also learnt the importance of placement and various aspects of sound such as its pitch, tempo and loudness.We event learnt the importance of layering sounds in the creation of chaos or to show a greater volume. For example, to show that multiple individuals were walking, we played the footsteps track twice but at a slight delay to give two distinct sounds. Similarly, to create a sense of chaos on the battlefield we played multiple gun fire and mortar tracks but spaced them out randomly. While we tried to make our sound piece sound war like, we often had to fade out gun fire sounds or mortar sounds to make sure the dialogues were audible and in focus as they lent direction to our story of life in the trenches.

    <h1>Creation of the website</h1>
    <h3>
    The creation of the website played a critical role in being able to showcase the setting of the scene and add some visual aspect to the sound story. We started with a basic birds-eye view of a World War 1 trench and placed 6 buttons across the image starting from the barracks and leading up to the frontlines. To guide the user as to which button to click next, we made the buttons hidden and they would only appear once the previous button had been clicked. The user can click the button once to start the audio file and twice to pause the file. At the end the user can see all buttons and can track the entire journey that the soldier made. The website used basic onclick animation in javascript to add interactivity but to ensure that the user interface was easy to understand and follow.

    <h1>Reflection/Evaluation:</h1>

    <h3>
      In the end most of the things that we aimed to put in the project were achieved. The experience that we aimed to give to the audience was achieved. But there were some things that we had to cut out due to inconsistency or being too ambitious. One was the use of different languages that we thought would bring more diversity and would be more accurate. This was scrapped for english dialogue as most users won't be able to understand the language and wont connect with the feelings of the soldiers. The other things that we wanted to add were subtle indications of different terrain and other small things but at the end most of them were scratched as it was too difficult to tell the subtle sounds apart from the louder ones. Overall, we were satisfied with the final output we produced based on the initial ideas we had. Although some ideas had to be dropped or modified, we took it in our stride as a learning experience. It taught us the nuances of creating a story to sound and the important aspects one needs to take into consideration while doing so.
